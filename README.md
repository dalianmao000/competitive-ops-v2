## What Is This

Competitive-Ops is a **Claude Code Skill** — a slash-command extension that turns Claude Code into a **competitive intelligence command center**.

### Pain Points Solved

- Manually researching competitors is **time-consuming and repetitive**
- Keeping up with pricing changes across 10+ providers is **impossible to do manually**
- No structured format for competitive analysis — results are **scattered and inconsistent**
- Re-running analysis means **starting from scratch** each time

### What You Get

Instead of manual research, you get an AI-powered pipeline:

- **Analyzes competitors** with structured SWOT + 6-dimension scoring
- **Generates professional reports** in Markdown + HTML
- **Tracks changes** with alerts for pricing and feature updates
- **Compares multiple competitors** side-by-side
- **Processes in batch** — analyze 10+ competitors in parallel (~3x speedup)
